# About Mwana
Breastfeeding works best when mothers have a knowledgeable and nurturing community to help them work through the inevitable questions and problems, as well as a supportive work environment, but not every mother has this. The app provides a virtual support system and tips for mothers to practice exclusive breastfeeding.

There are around 170 million mobile subscriptions in Nigeria. Currently, around 86 percent of the population is using a mobile phone *including* those in rural areas. The app will be an SMS (text message) and voice-based mobile phone application to account for those without smartphones. Mothers can join simply by texting a given phone number.

The breastfeeding app will be something of a virtual lactation counselor, helping mothers track their breastfeeding, while giving them valuable tips on latching, nutrition, milk production and formula harms. In a study on exclusive breastfeeding in Thailand, the most requested feature was a pump-reminding notification system. These notifications will be sent through SMS.
